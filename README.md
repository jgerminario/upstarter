[Upstarter](http://upstarter-client.herokuapp.com) gives job hunters investor-grade insight into the heated startup market, straight from a convenient hybrid mobile app.

Drawing on over 90,000 startups, Upstarter rank orders top companies by a "Momentum Score". Factoring in fundraising history, expenditures and employee count, the Momentum Score is a startup's percentile ranking compared to similar companies.

## How it works

Upon opening Upstarter, you can connect your LinkedIn account to view your connections to startups you lookup.

After loading the search page, you will see the top 10 hottest startups, ordered by their Momentum Score percentile.

You can search for individual startups from the top searchbar or filter by employee size and distance:

## How to get access

Upstarter is in pre-release alpha testing and will be deployed to iOS and Android stores before the end of February. Demo the app by cloning the repository and running ```ionic serve``` from the 'client' folder.

## Known issues

* Data requests access a remote Heroku server at upstarter-server.herokuapp.com, which may take a few moments to bootup after a period of low request volume. It could also result in slow search.

* Currently not all startups have employee data, leading to a number of startups without Momentum Scores. Alternatives have been identified and will be implemented.

* Intermittent error occurs where server crashes on Heroku without rebooting, causing client application to show no results. Looking into cause of error.

* CrunchBase employee data is not always accurate. Exploring how to pull from other data sources to come up with more accurate numbers.
