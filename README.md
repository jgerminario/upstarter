# Upstarter

Upstarter is your source for information about up-and-coming startups.

Upstarter is in pre-release alpha testing and will be deployed to iOS and Android stores before the end of February. Demo the app by cloning the repository and running ```ionic serve``` from the 'client' folder. To access integrated LinkedIn connection data, run `nodemon` or `npm start` from the 'server' folder and log into your LinkedIn account (oAuth access can be revoked at any time). 

All other data requests access a remote Heroku server at upstarter-server.herokuapp.com, which may take a few moments to bootup after a period of low request volume.

Please submit any feedback or suggestions in the issues of this repository. Onwards and upwards!
